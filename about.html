                <p>A reproduction and expansion of a project from a previous semester. This edition was created in Java, as opposed to C# like its predecessor. Includes basic calculation, trigonometry, hyperbolic trigonometry, and unit conversion to hexadecimal and binary both.</p>

                <h6>Python | Pygames</h6>
                <p>A recreation of the classic game 'Snake' in Python. Python was learned in the process of coding this game and allowed me to learn how I learn in the process. The wordplay was lost on me until I was releasing the project, to be completely honest. </p>
